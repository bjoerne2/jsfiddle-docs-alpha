Run in jsFiddle
---------------

One need to choose the framework and the Gist id using the URL:

URL: ``http://jsfiddle.net/gh/gist/{framework}/{version}/{gist_id}/``

Use ``library/pure`` for no framework:

URL: ``http://jsfiddle.net/gh/gist/library/pure/{gist_id}/``

There is an option to add dependencies as a comma separated list:

URL: ``http://jsfiddle.net/gh/gist/{framework}/{version}/dependencies/{dependency_list}/{gist_id}/``

**framework**
   the desired framework name. Which framework should be loaded with the fiddle.

**version**
   substring of the framework version - the last passing will be used. If 1.3 will be given, jsFiddle will use the latest search result. it will favorize 1.3.2 over 1.3.1 and 1.3
    
**dependency_list**
   comma separated list of dependency substrings. It would mark any dependency containing the substring.

**gist_id**
   gist id displayed in url ("http://gist.github.com/{username}/{gist_id}/")

Example
